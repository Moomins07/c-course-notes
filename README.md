# c-course-notes
My course notes from Microsoft's online C# modules. 
In this repository you will find all of the notes I have taken during the course(s). 
I will however endeavour to spend less time taking notes and more time commenting code.

I will first begin with: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/paths/csharp-first-steps/.
Followed by: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/paths/build-dotnet-applications-csharp/.
Finishing up with: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/paths/build-apps-with-dotnet-maui/?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003764.


Any code that is also written via VSCode as part of the course(s) will also be uploaded here.
