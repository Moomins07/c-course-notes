## Declaring a variable

To create a new variable in C#, we must first declare the data type of the variable and then give it a name.

E.g. string firstName;

This variable can now only hold string values.

Variable names shouldn't include the data type of the variable. You might see some advice to use a style like string strValue;. That advice is no longer current.

## IMPLICITLY TYPED LOCAL VARIABLES

We can also create implicitly typed local variables in C# which instructs the compiler to infer the data type depending on what we store in that variable.

We do this by using the 'var' syntax.
E.g. var message = "Hello world!";

We stored a string in our 'message' variable declared using 'var' and so therefore this variable is now a string-type.

However, once the variable type is set, we cannot then try to change that variable to another data type.

E.g. var message = "Hello World!";
message = 10.0m;

Will not work as C# cannot convert type decimal to string.

Var can also only be used if the variable is initialised (assigned a value as soon as it is declared).

var message; will not work.
var message = "String"; will work.
